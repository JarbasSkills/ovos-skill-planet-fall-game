## Planet Fall

"Join the Patrol, and see the Galaxy!" You took the poster's advice, bait and all, and marched right over to the recruitment station near your home on the backwater planet of Gallium. 

## Description

Images of exotic worlds, strange and colorful aliens and Deep Space heroism had danced in your head as you signed the dotted line. And since that day the closest you've come to Deep Space heroism was scrubbing down the radioactive leper colony on Ishmael-3.

## License and Source code

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/historicalsource/planetfall).  It is not considered to be under an open license.

As far as I know, Activision have still not declared the games abandonware. 

But I do not believe that it is in the spirit of copyright law that works of art drift into oblivion by unavailability. 
 
The day the games are republished in their old glory, I will gladly remove the files from this repository. Until then, I hope they will be allowed to remain here so you can have fun playing them in a novel way.
